-------------------------BackendDevelopment---------------
it has 2 major components
1) a programming language - java, js, php, golang
2) a database - mongo, mysql, postgres, sqlite 

browser  <---->  |  A | <---->   backend <----> | D |
                 |  P |                         |   | <----> another continent
mobile   <---->  |  I | <---->   backend <----> | B |

------------JAVASCRIPT SPECIFIC-------------------
-in JS based backend we had to deal with 3 things
1) data
2) file
3) third party(API)

-in JS we had many runtime choices like Nodejs/Deno/Bun

-File Structure
Package.json     .env    (readme, git, lint, prettier etc)

-while making an backend we had directory structre as --
  index                APP                 constants
(DB Connects)    (config, cookies)      (DB-name, enums)

-DB           (actual code that connects the data)
-Models       (data schema)
-Controllers  (methods or functions of data)
-Routes       (/signup etc)
-MiddleWares  ()
-Utils        (utility)
-More(depends)




--First thing before starting an project is we had to find what data we had to store

#  for module type importing in package.json firstly we have to write type under description as module and then get the command from nodemon and execute on terminal
then we get a new folder as node modules and then we have to change the script as 
"dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
